# 🏠 Real Estate Price Prediction in Bengaluru

This project allows users to **predict the price of a house in Bengaluru** based on key features such as location, area (in square feet), number of bathrooms, and BHK configuration. It's a simple yet powerful web-based machine learning application aimed at helping users make informed real estate decisions.

## 🧪 Model Training (Optional)

If you'd like to retrain the model:
  cd server/model
  python model_training.py
This script processes the dataset and retrains the regression model with updated data.
